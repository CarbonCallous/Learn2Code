      <h2>Who am I?.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a developer located in Atlanta. My experience has provided a balance of customer centric and business analytic approach to design principles. 
        <br><br>
        I have a passion for coding and challenges that was slowly nurtured from a kid with his Legos to an adult with a family building various items around the house. 
        <br><br>
        My family inspires me, on my day to day journey. Fan of challenges and puzzles, all things video games related, recently took up trying to hit a tiny ball into a cup (can't call it golf, not that good yet).
